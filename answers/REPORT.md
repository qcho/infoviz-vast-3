# VAST 2018: Mini-Challenge 3

## Question 1

To analyze the growth of the company, we first started with the analysis of how many people were active throughout the whole timeline inside the company. While tracking active employees, we also tracked how many employees left the company. We decided that an employees date of termination was the date of his last activity inside the company. To remove some noise from the visualizations, we are grouping the information in months.

As we can see here, there's a linear progression in the amount of active employees each month, giving the impression of growth. And we can see that there's very few employees that stop being active each month. To be able to better see this, we've plotted only the leaving users and capping the y-axis to 16000.

There's a strange decrease of active users in the last two months, but we attribute that to the fact that there's missing data at the end of the timeline.

However, when analyzing the activity inside the information, we get a very different picture:

Even though we have a linear increase in employees, we can see that throught out the period, there's almost a constant amount of purchases, calls and emails, having only the meetings increasing.

Therefore we could assume that the Company is growing in number of people but hasn't grown in the economical sense.
